# Git `file` transport

See `repro.sh`.

```sh
cd super
git submodule add ../sub
```

This results in:

> fatal: transport 'file' not allowed

This is a new limitation which seems to have come about as a result of a patch
related to security.

# Workaround

`git -c protocol.file.allow=always submodule add ../sub`
